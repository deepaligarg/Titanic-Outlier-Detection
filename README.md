# Titanic-Outlier-Detection
This repository contains the python code for detecting outliers and removing/transformimg them in a Titanic Dataset.

The outliers are detected plotting **histograms**, **distplots** and **boxplots** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** Libraries. Once the outliers are detected, they are transformed using **IQR** (Inter Quartile Range) and are capped using the upper and the lower value boundaries.
